# Question 1
##### Eli Schiff
##### Graduating in Fall 2021
##### I dont have a specific project idea yet, but I am leaning towards working on a website of some sort. I already know a bit of web dev but I want to expand my knowledge some more. That said I am also taking with friends about working on a project with them and if they dont want to work on a website that is ok with me.
